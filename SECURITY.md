## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have discovered a vulnerability in this library, please [report it confidentially by creating a new security advisory for this repository on GitHub](https://github.com/mbg/wai-saml2/security/advisories/new). A [good template for reporting vulnerabilities](https://github.com/github/securitylab/blob/dc3f4357b72c2ed23020615117b431fe573b7134/docs/report-template.md) was put created by GitHub's Security Lab if you want to use it.

When reporting a vulnerability, please try to include enough instructions to allow the issue to be recreated. Please also include information about the potential impact of the vulnerability, any pre-conditions that need to be met. If you have a suggested remediation, we would be thankful if you include it as well.

If the vulnerability is confirmed, we will aim to fix it as soon as possible.

Once fixed, the security advisory you filed will be published publicly and you will be credited.
